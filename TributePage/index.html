                Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely known for developing the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His most famous equation, ùê∏ = ùëö ùëê2, expresses the idea that energy and mass are interchangeable,

                laying the foundation for much of modern physics.
                Einstein's work revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. His theory of general relativity, published in 1915, provided a new understanding of gravitation, which was later confirmed through experimental evidence, such as the bending of light around the Sun during a solar eclipse.

                In addition to his contributions to theoretical physics, Einstein was a passionate advocate for civil rights, education, and world peace. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was pivotal in the development of quantum theory.
                Einstein emigrated to the United States in 1933, fleeing the rise of the Nazi regime, and continued his scientific work at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.
